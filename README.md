# TodoList Smart Contract

## Vision

The TodoList Smart Contract project aims to provide a decentralized solution for managing tasks on a blockchain platform. Inspired by the simplicity and effectiveness of traditional todo lists, this smart contract implementation leverages blockchain technology to offer secure, transparent, and immutable task management.

### Why TodoList on the Blockchain?

Traditional todo lists are often managed through centralized applications or services, which can be susceptible to data manipulation, censorship, or service interruptions. By migrating task management to a blockchain, we aim to address these limitations by:

- **Decentralization**: Tasks are stored on a distributed ledger, eliminating single points of failure and providing greater resilience against censorship or data tampering.
  
- **Transparency**: All task-related transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and auditability. Users can verify the history of task additions, updates, and deletions.

- **Immutability**: Once added to the blockchain, tasks cannot be altered or deleted arbitrarily. This ensures the integrity and permanence of task records, fostering trust among users.

### Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to the TodoList by providing a description of the task.
  
- **Toggle Task Completion**: Tasks can be marked as completed or pending, allowing users to track their progress.
  
- **Delete Tasks**: Users have the option to remove tasks from the TodoList when they are no longer relevant or necessary.
  
- **List Tasks**: The contract provides a functionality to list all tasks associated with a specific owner's address.

### Technologies Used

- **Rust**: The smart contract is implemented in Rust programming language, known for its performance, safety, and concurrency features.

- **Soroban SDK**: This project utilizes the Soroban SDK for interacting with the blockchain, making it easier to develop, deploy, and manage smart contracts.

### Getting Started

To get started with the TodoList Smart Contract, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Rust and Soroban SDK installed on your development environment.

2. **Clone Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

3. **Build and Deploy**: Build the smart contract code and deploy it to your desired blockchain network using Soroban SDK.

4. **Interact**: Once deployed, interact with the smart contract using supported methods to add, toggle, delete, or list tasks.
